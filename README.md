# Pro Tips: Mastering Long-Term Memory in Pieces

A collection of pro tips for mastering Long-Term Memory (LTM) in Pieces Copilot—unlock smarter workflows, richer context, and more powerful AI assistance.

## What is Long-Term Memory?

Pieces Copilot uses Long-Term Memory (LTM) to remember your work throughout the day. As you work across different applications, Pieces passively captures context from what you're doing—creating a searchable memory you can query anytime using natural language.

Think of it like having a perfect memory of everything you've worked on, researched, or discussed—ready to help you find exactly what you need, when you need it.

## What's in This Repository

This repository contains practical guides and examples to help you master LTM queries and get the most out of Pieces Copilot:

2. **Ready to practice?** Jump to the 10 example queries and try them yourself
3. **Want to master it?** Experiment with combining different query elements and refine your approach

## Key Principles

The best LTM queries combine these elements:
- ⏰ **Time** — When did it happen? ("yesterday", "last week", "in August")
- 📱 **Source** — Where did it happen? ("in VS Code", "from Teams", "in Chrome")
- ✋ **Gestures** — What were you doing? ("copied", "searched", "created")
- 🎯 **Topic** — What project or theme? ("customer portal authentication", "cloud security")
- 👥 **People** — Who were you working with? ("Sarah", "the security team")

**Remember**: Write naturally, like you're asking a colleague. You don't need all five elements—even one or two will get you great results.

## What LTM Captures

LTM automatically captures context from:
- Code editors and IDEs (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.)
- Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Communication tools (Teams, Slack, Discord)
- Documentation platforms (Notion, Confluence, GitHub)
- Terminal and command line

All of this becomes searchable through natural language queries—no need to remember exact details or file names.

## Getting Started

The best way to get good at LTM queries? **Just start asking.** Try different phrasings, experiment with time references, and see what works. You'll get the hang of it quickly.
