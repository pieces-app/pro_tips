**Release Date:** December 23, 2025

**PiecesOS:** 12.3.4

Welcome to Pieces Desktop 5.0.0, powered by PiecesOS 12.3.4—our most significant update yet! This release represents a complete reimagining of how you interact with Pieces, bringing a calmer, more intuitive experience while adding powerful new capabilities that help you capture, understand, and share your work like never before.

## 🏡 A New Home Base — A Calm, Consistent Starting Point

We've consolidated what used to be multiple entry points into a new **Home Base** that's designed to feel calmer, clearer, and easier to learn. Navigation is simpler, common actions are more consistent, and headers/layout conventions are standardized so the UI behaves the way you expect—no matter where you are in the app.

From Home Base you can quickly start a new chat, pick up where you left off, or generate a helpful artifact without hunting through menus. We're excited to end the year strong, and we're genuinely pumped for everything we're building next in 2026.

### What's Changed

**Unified Navigation**
- All major features now accessible from a single, clean home view
- Consistent header layouts across all sections
- Standardized action buttons and menus
- No more hunting for where things are located

**Simplified Entry Points**
- Start a new Copilot chat with one click
- Resume your most recent conversation instantly
- Generate workstream summaries without navigating away
- Access your saved materials and memories from the same place

**Visual Consistency**
- Predictable layouts that work the same everywhere
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Reduced cognitive load with simpler information architecture

### Why It Matters

The old multi-entry-point approach often left users wondering "where do I go to do X?" Now, you start from one place and everything flows naturally from there. This is especially helpful when you're learning Pieces or coming back after some time away—the app just makes sense.

## 🔍 Browse, Converse, Generate — Without Leaving Your Flow

We've worked hard to make Pieces feel more fluid: you can **filter, explore, and chat** while staying in the same place. From a single view, you can narrow down what you're looking at—by chat type, summary type, source, or artifact category—and then immediately ask a question or generate something new.

It reduces the "find the right screen" problem and replaces it with a simpler loop: browse what you have, refine it with quick filters, and take action right away. The result is a more natural workflow, especially when your library grows into the thousands.

### What's New

**Powerful In-Place Filtering**
- Filter chats by type, date, or topic without leaving the view
- Narrow workstream summaries by generation type or time range
- Browse saved materials by language, framework, or source
- Search and filter work together seamlessly

**Instant Actions**
- Ask questions about filtered content immediately
- Generate new artifacts based on what you're viewing
- Share or export without switching contexts
- Copy, edit, or delete items inline

**Smart Context Awareness**
- Filters remember your preferences per view
- Quick-access presets for common filtering patterns
- Real-time search that updates as you type
- No page refreshes or view transitions needed

*Filter, search, and take action—all in one unified view.*

### Why It Matters

As your Pieces library grows—whether it's hundreds of chats, thousands of memories, or countless saved materials—finding what you need becomes critical. These filters let you slice through the noise without losing your place or breaking your flow. You can go from "show me all my React work from last month" to "start a new chat about it" in seconds.

## 👤 Personalization, Ownership, and Disambiguation

Pieces is getting noticeably better at understanding **what's yours, what belongs to others, and how your work fits together over time**. With our new **Personification and Disambiguation engines**, the app can build a more accurate picture of who you are, what you're focused on, and who you collaborate with—without blending contexts that shouldn't be mixed.

That improved clarity makes everything downstream feel more relevant: summaries read more like they were written for you, hints land with better timing, and freeform chats stay grounded in your actual projects and priorities.

### What's Improved

**Smarter Personal Context**
- Pieces now distinguishes between your code and code you're reviewing
- Understands which projects are yours vs. collaborative work
- Recognizes your writing style and technical preferences
- Builds a clearer picture of your expertise areas over time

**Better Collaboration Recognition**
- Accurately identifies who you work with most frequently
- Understands team dynamics and collaboration patterns
- Separates your contributions from team discussions
- Maintains context about who said what and when

**Contextual Intelligence**
- Summaries focus on what matters to *you* specifically
- Copilot responses grounded in *your* actual work
- Suggestions based on *your* patterns and preferences
- Memory formation aligned with *your* priorities

![Pieces now understands you better—your work, your team, your priorities](https://storage.googleapis.com/pieces_static_resources/pro_tips/5_0_0_becoming_more_you_light.png)
*Pieces now understands you better—your work, your team, your priorities.*

### Why It Matters

Generic AI assistants treat everyone the same. Pieces learns who you are, what you care about, and how you work. The Personification engine means when you ask "what did I work on this week?", you get *your* work—not a mix of everything that happened in shared channels. When you generate a standup, it focuses on *your* contributions, not the entire team's. This personal touch makes Pieces feel less like a tool and more like a teammate who really knows you.

## ☀️ Single‑Click Summaries

Pieces now includes a set of **well-timed, single-click summaries** you can rely on day-to-day—like a **Morning Brief, Day Recap, and Standup Update**. Instead of figuring out the perfect prompt (or remembering what to ask), you can generate a clean, structured summary instantly, with sections like TL;DR, key accomplishments, and context on how the day unfolded.

These summaries are designed to be quick to scan, easy to share, and consistent enough to become part of your daily rhythm—whether you're starting the morning, wrapping up at night, or sending an update to your team.

### Available Summaries

**Morning Brief** ☀️
- TL;DR of where you left off yesterday
- Yesterday's key accomplishments
- What matters most today
- Heads up items that need attention
- Perfect for starting your day with clarity

**Day Recap** 🌙
- Today's accomplishments and wins
- What you worked on throughout the day
- Feedback and areas for improvement
- Ready to share with your team or review personally

**Standup Update** 📋
- What you did yesterday
- What you're working on today
- Any blockers or challenges
- Formatted for team standups and status updates

**Week Recap** 📅
- Your week at a glance
- Major accomplishments and milestones
- Projects and themes from the week
- Perfect for weekly reviews or reporting

![Generate comprehensive daily summaries with a single click](https://storage.googleapis.com/pieces_static_resources/pro_tips/5_0_0_the_easiest_way_to_start_end_and_share_your_day_light.png)
*Generate comprehensive daily summaries with a single click.*

### How to Use Them

1. **From Home Base:** Look for the "Quick Summaries" section
2. **Choose Your Summary Type:** Morning Brief, Day Recap, or Standup
3. **One Click:** Generate in seconds with pre-configured time ranges
4. **Review and Share:** Edit if needed, then copy, export, or share

### Why It Matters

You shouldn't need to remember the perfect prompt or spend time crafting the right question. These summaries give you professional, consistent output that becomes part of your daily routine. Start your morning with clarity about what matters today. End your day with a clean recap you can share. Update your team without rewriting the same information. It's the easiest way to stay organized and communicate effectively.

### Why It Matters

These improvements are the foundation that makes everything else possible. You might not consciously notice each individual upgrade, but you'll feel the cumulative effect: Pieces responds faster, understands you better, and scales seamlessly as your memory library grows. Whether you're processing hundreds of events per day or querying memories from months ago, the infrastructure is now robust enough to handle it all without breaking a sweat.
