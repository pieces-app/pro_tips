## Query Best Practices

### Effective Query Strategies:

- **Be specific:** "authentication bug fix" is better than "that bug"  
- **Mention timeframes:** "a few weeks ago" or "last quarter" helps narrow results  
- **Include context:** Mention related projects, people, or tools to help Pieces find it  
- **Use natural language:** Ask like you're talking to a colleague  
- **Combine elements:** Time + topic + modality = better results

### When to Use Each Type:

- **Search Queries (1-2):** Use daily when you need to find something specific  
- **Collaboration & Efficiency (3-4):** Use monthly to understand patterns and optimize  
- **Strategic Planning (5):** Use quarterly for performance reviews and planning
